# Project 02

Project 02 involves creating a PCB for the programmable music box implemented and described in the ENGI301/project01 folder in this repo. More specifically, the PCB created is intended to host all components (or connectors to components, if they are too big) necessary for the programmable music box to run. 

In addition to a Bill-of-Materials and and PCB Schematic, this directory contains the following folders:

### EAGLE
This folder contains the Eagle files of my PCB, and include schematic, board, as well as a library with all parts used.

### MFG
This folder contains all the Gerber manufacturing files needed to actually manufacture my PCB

### docs
This folder contains documentation relevant in the planning of my PCB, as well as images of the top and bottom views of my PCB (per the Gerber files).
